    "# Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, particularly in scenarios involving \n",

    "\n",
    "# 1. Memory Efficiency\n",
    "# Reduced Memory Usage: Generators produce values one at a time and only keep track of the state needed to produce \n",
    "# the next value. This means they do not store the entire sequence in memory, making them highly memory-efficient, \n",
    "# especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Lazy Evaluation\n",
    "# On-Demand Computation: Generators compute values only when needed. This \"lazy\" evaluation avoids unnecessary \n",
    "# computations and can speed up performance when dealing with large or potentially infinite sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Simpler Code for Complex Iterations\n",
    "# Cleaner and More Readable: Generators simplify the code required to handle complex sequences and state management. \n",
    "# The yield statement encapsulates the iteration logic and state management within a single function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Improved Performance\n",
    "# Avoiding Unnecessary Computation: Since generators yield values one at a time, they can start processing and producing \n",
    "# results immediately without waiting to build the entire sequence. This can lead to performance improvements, especially \n",
    "# in streaming data scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.  Infinite Sequences\n",
    "# Handling Infinite Iterations: Generators can represent infinite sequences without consuming infinite memory. \n",
    "# They generate values on demand, making it practical to work with sequences that theoretically never end.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. State Management\n",
    "# Automatic State Preservation: Generators automatically preserve their execution state between yield calls. \n",
    "# This eliminates the need for explicit state management and complex loop constructs, leading to cleaner and more \n",
    "# maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Ease of Implementation\n",
    "# Reduced Boilerplate Code: Generators can replace more complex code that would otherwise involve maintaining state \n",
